    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise a potential client to secure his/her website through seven steps:</p>

    <p>1. Keep everyone involved. In order to be able to offer a secure product, it is important that everyone involved in development of the website keeps security as first priority, not only in initial development, but continuously. This requires a lot of education and testing/scanning for vulnerability.</p>
        
    <p>2. Introduce guidelines through a cybersecurity framework, to create an overall picture of potential dangers, as well as plans and checklists to overcome these.</p>
        
    <p>3. Use automatic and integrated security tools for security processes. This makes the work less, closes the room for errors and increases the chance of discovering issues earlier.</p>
        
    <p>4. Avoid errors in the code by using developers who understand potential security problems, for example SQL injections, XSS and CSRF. And which is focused on discovering errors and vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.</p>
        
    <p>5. Use a wide range of automatic and integrated security measures, for example various vulnerability scanners and a web application firewall (WAF).</p>
        
    <p>6. In addition to penetration tests, conduct continuous security exercises through mock attacks to protect against the real ones.</p>
        
    <p>7. Offer bounty programs that allow/encourage hackers to discover security issues. This benefits the brand's status as being aware of security.</p>
